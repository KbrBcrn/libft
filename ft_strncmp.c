*	#include <string.h>
*	DESCRIPTION
* 	The strncmp() function compares not more than n characters. Because 
*	strncmp() is designed for comparing strings rather than binary data, 
*	characters that appear after a `\0' character are not compared.
*	PARAMETERS
*	#1. The first str to compare.
*	#2. The second str to compare.
*	#3. The number of bytes to compare the two strings.
*	RETURN VALUES
*	The strncmp() function returns an integer greater than, equal to, or less 
*	than 0, according as the string s1 is greater than, equal to, or less than 
*	the string s2.  The comparison is done using unsigned characters, so that 
*	`\200' is greater than `\0'.
